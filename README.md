# History
This tool was created out of the need to manage lab systems:
  * infrastructure as code
  * nodes come and go. Still i would not like to unjoin and join nodes permantly. Why not a "virtual cluster"
  * if i screwed up an OS, maybe i just want to flash to os partition but leave the data partition untouched


# Environment Variables
* PX_CONFIG_FILE_PATH
* HOME
