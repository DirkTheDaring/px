SHUTDOWN-VM(1)                            Proxmox Virtual Environment                           SHUTDOWN-VM(1)

NAME
       shutdown-vm - Shut down a virtual machine in Proxmox Virtual Environment

SYNOPSIS
       shutdown-vm [OPTIONS] <VMID>

DESCRIPTION
       The shutdown-vm command is used to gracefully shut down a virtual machine (VM) running on Proxmox Virtual
       Environment (PVE). This ensures that the VM is powered off safely, allowing for the proper termination of
       processes and file system operations.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help message and exit.

       -f, --force
              Forcefully shut down the VM without attempting a graceful shutdown. This can result in data loss
              and should be used with caution.

ARGUMENTS
       VMID   The unique identifier of the virtual machine you want to shut down.

EXAMPLES
       To gracefully shut down a virtual machine with VMID 100, use the following command:

              shutdown-vm 100

       To force shutdown a virtual machine with VMID 200, use the following command:

              shutdown-vm -f 200
